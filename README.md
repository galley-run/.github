# Galley

**Galley** is a developer-friendly **EU-sovereign Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**.  
It lets you **push code → deploy apps & databases** in minutes — without the complexity of Kubernetes or the risks of US Cloud Act hosting.

> Deploy with confidence. Hosted in the EU. GDPR by design.

## 🚀 Why Galley?

Infrastructure should not be a full-time job for small teams.  
With Galley you can focus on **building software**, not fighting servers.

- **Sovereignty & GDPR** – Your apps and data stay in the EU.  
- **Simple workflow** – Sign up → Push → Deploy.  
- **Predictable costs** – No hidden usage traps.  
- **Developer-first** – Lightweight, fast, easy to adopt.
